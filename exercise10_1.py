Exercise  10.1: Revise a previous program as follows: Read and parse the "From"
lines and pull out the addresses from the line. Count the number of messages
from each person using a dictionary.

After all the data has been read, print the person with the most commits by
creating a list of (count, email) tuples from the dictionary. Then sort the
list in the reverse order and print out the person who has the most commits.
