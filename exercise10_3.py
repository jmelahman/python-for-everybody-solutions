Exercise  10.3: Write a program that reads a file and prints the letters in
decreasing order of frequency. Your program should convert all the input to
lower case and only count the letters a-z. Your program should not count
spaces, digits, punctuation, or anything other than letters a-z. Find text
samples from several different languages and see how letter frequency varies
between languages. Compare your results with the tables at
wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies
